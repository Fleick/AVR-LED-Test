AVR-LED-Test
======================================

A small test for setting Registers of AVR as Output and switching them on and off. 
In this Project we use 9 LEDs (3 per Register[B,C,D]) for testing.   
The LEDS are attached to the following pins:

|  LED  |  PIN  | 
|:-----:|:-----:|
|1|PD2|
|2|PD3|
|3|PD4|
|4|PC0|
|5|PC1|
|6|PC2|
|7|PB0|
|8|PB1|
|9|PB2|

The Program runs a small "Show" through the LEDs to prove the output writing is working.
The AVR frequency is set to 1Mhz.
